        Container.js <h2>Props</h2>
        <p>
          The name prop on the render of Container in App.js passes down the information to the actual Container. <br />
          {this.props.nick} {"<="} This is the prop.
        </p>
        <h2>State</h2>
        <p>
          The state of a component is essentialy the temporary data the component uses. State can be any form of data,
          but should be able to be updated. To access state in jsx, we use the 'this' key word. Here is the state of
          Container: <b>{this.state.stateprop1}</b>.
        </p>
        <h2>Updating State</h2>
        <h3>Incorrect</h3>
        <p>
          State should NEVER be mutated directly. For example; the button below <i>should</i> call a function that
          changes state directly. However, it doesn't work becuase React doesn't allow direct change of state. It would
          leave us no access to the previous state, it would mutate the state. Instead, we use the{" "}
          <code>setState()</code> method.
        </p>
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            this.changeStateWrong();
          }}
        >
          Change State Directly
        </button>
        <p>
          <b>{this.state.stateprop1}</b>
        </p>
        <h3>Correct</h3>
        <p>
          To update state correctly, we use the <code>setState()</code> method. This is a method on the component class
          that allows us to update state and merge the old state with the new. This means we do not mutate the original
          state, but merge it with the new state. This has the same effect, but still allows us to access the previous
          state. The button below calls a function that uses the <code>setState()</code> method, click it and see the
          state update across the page.
        </p>
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            this.changeStateCorrect();
          }}
        >
          Change State by setState()
        </button>
        <p>
          <b>{this.state.stateprop1}</b>
        </p>
        <h3>PrevState</h3>
        <p>
          It may be beneficial to update state based on the previous state. This is most easily recognizable in a simple
          counter. To demonstate this we will initialize a state of '0', then we will increment it by 1 when the button
          is clicked.
        </p>
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            this.incrementCount();
          }}
        >
          Increment
        </button>
        <p>
          <b>{this.state.stateCounter}</b>
        </p>
        <h3>Updating Multiple States in One Component</h3>
        <p>
          Since React merges the previous component state with the new component state it is possible to update
          individual properties in each componenet state. FOr example, out component currently has 2 states. The first
          displays the string "Out initial state", the second is a counter initialized to 0. Since state is an object,
          we can say that these are both properties of the same object. React's merging allows us to manipulate one
          state without effecting the other. Below are two buttons and the displays of our two initial states. When
          clicking either button, the state is updated and merged with the old state. We know this is the case since the
          counter doesn't reset to 0 and the string doesn't reset to it's initial value.
        </p>
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            this.incrementCount();
          }}
        >
          Increment
        </button>
        <p>
          <b>{this.state.stateCounter}</b>
        </p>
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            this.changeState();
          }}
        >
          Change String
        </button>
        <p>
          <b>{this.state.stateprop1}</b>
        </p>
      </div>
